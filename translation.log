Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there lived a man named John. One day, while walking down the street, he noticed a wallet lying on the ground. Curiosity got the better of him and he picked it up to examine its contents. Inside, he found identification cards and money.

John decided to do the right thing and return the wallet to its owner. He searched for contact information but couldn't find any. Determined not to give up, he went through some receipts inside the wallet and discovered an address.

He arrived at the address only to find out that nobody by that name lived there anymore. Feeling disheartened, John asked around if anyone knew who owned this lost wallet. After several inquiries, someone recognized the person from one of the identification cards as their neighbor's cousin.

John contacted his neighbor who then connected him with his cousin. It turned out that she had lost her wallet earlier that day while shopping nearby and was devastated when she realized it was missing.

Filled with gratitude, she thanked John profusely for returning her belongings intact. She insisted on giving him a reward but John politely declined saying that doing good deeds should be enough reward in itself.
